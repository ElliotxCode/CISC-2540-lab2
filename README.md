# CISC-2540-lab2

By using the 'A' and 'D' key on your keyboard, the sprite reacts to the user input. By clicking 'D' the user triggers the spite to move right and by clicking 'A' the sprite reacts by moving left. I liked getting familiar with the backend of Godot and configuring the project settings + input map.
